# postalCodesMexicoXlsx
I made a examen test that about to get all data from specific zip-code, this zip-code is inserted in a path
from URL like /zip-code/{zipCode}, i explain how i did it:

1. I used IDE Eclipse (STS) to use java 1.8 version wiht framework SpringBoot.
2. To test the REST service i used POSTMAN, this program let use REST services and show the result, can be
positive or negative with a http codes, also shows the body response without use a front page.
3. After the codes was successfuly, i used the jUnitTest, to test the code at a simple way.
4.I try to run my app with googlecloud but i havent success, because appengine show me an error,
but in a error panel within appengine doesnt show me that error, i try to verify what happen, but
i think i need to take one curse about it to dont waste much time, i think is easy but i dont for the moment
how to do it.
5. i download a excel file by the link you got me, i read with java that file and i find that zipcode
and return the information about that zipcode.
6. The code is in github in this link... https://github.com/marrongit/postalCodesMexicoXlsx

NOTE: i didnt want use a DB, beacuse the way to test this examen can be dificult.
